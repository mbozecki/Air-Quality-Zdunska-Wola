<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This app has been made to raise awareness about air pollution in my home city, Zduńska Wola. 
Our city has installed a few devices measuring air pollution, but the data from them is unreadeable at first glance (https://www.airqlab.pl/polair_ZW.php), so it doesn't have enough impact on people living here.
Local ecologists asked me to make a simple app which will get this data and present it in a friendly way. So here it is!


### Built With


* Java (in Android Studio)
* JSoup (for scraping data from airqlab.pl/polair_ZW.php)
* Sliding Root Nav (for a cool navigation) https://github.com/yarolegovich/SlidingRootNav
* Paris (for changing styles while app is running) https://github.com/airbnb/paris


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Installation

Just get the app from Google Play Store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.edu.uwr.pum.air_app) or clone the repository and open it in Android Studio!
